"""
Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than size of array, we need to find the kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Examples:  

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15} 
k = 3 
Output: 7

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15} 
k = 4 
Output: 10 

"""
#Bruteforce approach is to sort the array and print the kth index element of the array.

for i in range(0,n):

    a.append(x)
